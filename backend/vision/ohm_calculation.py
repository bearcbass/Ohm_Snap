    This color coordination gets a bit confusing.
    The first band can never be black since, we will
    be multiplying by 0 resistance. 
    Next, each color is associated with a value, 
    lets just stick to three bands for now
    
    Black = 0, brown = 1, red = 2, orange = 3, yellow = 4,
    Green = 5, blue = 6, violet = 7, grey = 8, white = 9

    Let us assume that each row in the matrix is already masked with the proper values.

    The next step is just caluclating. 

    DO NOT FORGET: -1 is a magic value, it indicates that there is no 4-6th band
    The reason for this data being kept is that we may have multiple resistors 
    with varying bands

    Cool lets get to coding.
